# Find-Missing-Numbers

For example: This is a Python-based solution for finding the missing number in a list containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n]. It uses the XOR approach to efficiently find the missing number in O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.

Features
Efficiently finds the missing number in an array of distinct numbers.

Uses the XOR method to achieve constant space complexity.

Simple and fast with an optimal time complexity of O(n).
